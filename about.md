**Hi i'm Samuel Wasswa!**

 Am a **Technology enthusiast**, **Software Developer** and **Writer**. Am currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Information Technology at Carnegie Mellon University where I dabble in Machine Learning mostly.

I have mostly been writing **Ruby/Rails** but I have recently started getting my feet wet with **Elixir/Phoenix**.

After hours am a football fanatic obsessively analysing tactics and supporting my favorite team.
