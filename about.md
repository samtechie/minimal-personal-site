**Hi i'm Samuel Wasswa!**

 Am a **Software Developer** and **Data Science Enthusiast** with a keen interest in **Machine Learning** and more recently **Data Engineering**.

I have mostly been working with **Ruby/Rails** for web development. I built a convolutional neural network that can accurately classify Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Chest X-rays with [SemanticMD](https://semantic.md/) a company that specializes in medical image analysis.

Currently, I spend my time exploring the Data Engineering landscape where I work with Big Data tools like **Hadoop** and **Spark**.

After hours am a football fanatic obsessively analysing tactics and supporting my favorite team, working on short stories or gobbling up a new high fantasy book.
