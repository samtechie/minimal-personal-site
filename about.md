**Hi i'm Samuel Wasswa!**

 Am a **Software Developer** and **Data Science Enthusiast** with a keen interest in **Machine Learning**. Am currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Information Technology at Carnegie Mellon University where I dabble in Machine Learning mostly.

I have mostly been working with **Ruby/Rails** a bit of **Python/Flask** and I now spend most of my time trying out **Deep Learning** a field which has taken my fancy using libraries like **Keras/Tensorflow** and **PyTorch**. Currently, I am working on a convolutional neural network that can accurately classify Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Chest X-rays with [SemanticMD](https://semantic.md/) a company that specializes in medical image analysis.


After hours am a football fanatic obsessively analysing tactics and supporting my favorite team, working on short stories or gobbling up a new high fantasy book.
