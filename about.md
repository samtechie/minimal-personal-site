**Hi i'm Samuel Wasswa!**

 Am a **Technology enthusiast**, **Software Developer** and **Writer**. Am currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Information Technology at Carnegie Mellon University where I dabble in Machine Learning mostly.

I have mostly been working with **Ruby/Rails** but I have recently started getting my feet wet with **Elixir/Phoenix** and I have to say am completely in love with it.

After hours am a football fanatic obsessively analysing tactics and supporting my favorite team, working on short stories or gobbling up a new high fantasy book.
